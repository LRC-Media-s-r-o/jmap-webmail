# JMAP Webmail

A modern, privacy-focused webmail client built with Next.js and the JMAP protocol.

## Built for Stalwart

This webmail client is designed to work seamlessly with [**Stalwart Mail Server**](https://stalw.art/) - a modern, secure, and blazingly fast mail server written in Rust.

**Why Stalwart?**
- **Modern Architecture**: Built from the ground up with Rust for performance and safety
- **JMAP-Native**: First-class support for the JMAP protocol (not just IMAP/SMTP bolted on)
- **Privacy-Focused**: Self-hosted, no third-party dependencies, full control over your data
- **Feature-Rich**: Supports JMAP, IMAP, SMTP, ManageSieve, and more

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **State Management**: [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)
- **JMAP Client**: [jmap-jam](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jmap-jam)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A JMAP-compatible mail server (we recommend [Stalwart](https://stalw.art/))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/root-fr/jmap-webmail.git
cd jmap-webmail

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment configuration
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### Configuration

Edit `.env.local` with your settings:

```env
# App name displayed in the UI
APP_NAME=My Webmail

# Your JMAP server URL (required)
JMAP_SERVER_URL=https://mail.example.com
```

**Note:** These are runtime environment variables, read at request time. This enables Docker deployments to be configured without rebuilding the image. Legacy `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables are still supported as fallbacks.

### Development

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run typecheck

# Linting
npm run lint
```

### Production Build

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

### Docker

```bash
# Using docker-compose
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your JMAP_SERVER_URL
docker compose up -d

# Or build manually
docker build -t jmap-webmail .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e JMAP_SERVER_URL=https://mail.example.com jmap-webmail
```
